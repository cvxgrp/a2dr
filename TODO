============
1. Allow step size parameter (rho) to differ across variables, not threads (i.e., each variable id is associated with a unique rho, and threads that share a variable should initialize rho to the same value for that variable.)

2. Keep track of variable(s) shared across multiple threads. Each thread should only send its shared variable(s) to the reducer, so private variable(s) are never seen by the reducer or other threads.

============
1. Add examples on the following topics:
    a. Network flow (with > 2 partitions).
    b. Federated learning.
    c. Engineering design (power/area).

============
1. Compare results when AA-II weights problem is solved with/without l2-regularization.

2. Add examples on the following topics:
     a. Machine learning.
     b. Floor planning.

============
1. Finish implementation of simple proximal operator functions.
	a. Factor out any constant multiplicative term into rho, e.g. prox_{c*f}(x, rho) becomes prox_{f}(x, rho/c).
	b. Enable user-specified initialization of proximal parameter y (for each unique variable id).
2. General projection onto set of linear constraints in equation (9) of A2DR notes. Use numpy.linalg.lsqr to get the inverse of MM^T.
